UtilsMessage is a plugin created by me that only aims to be an asset for your server and avoid you to use tiers plugins. This plugin will allow you to create automatic messages with a possible interval change.

This plugin have only 2 commands fully customizable by the config.yml :
 
/discord --> Show your discord server link.
/site --> Show your website link.
 
And :
/utilsreload --> Allows to reload the config.yml.

Don't forget to add this permissions to your rank: "utilsmessage.reload"
